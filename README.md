# DarkDisk_Microlensing
This code is used to compute forecasts of microlensing constraints on dark compact objects with arbitrary Galactic distributions. The specific Galactic distributions that can be tested are included in the [density_funcs.py] file. The python functions for generating the plots in the paper are included in the [plotgen_routines.py] file. The Jupyter notebook for displaying the plots from the data files included is [plot_routines.ipynb].
